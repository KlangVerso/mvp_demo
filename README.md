This repo contains the current working Minimum Viable Product Demo and is intended to be used to show Pilot customers
and potential investors the product's initial capabilities. The site is modular to reflect the products design
architecture, which allows us to continue to improve the design and capabilities without needed to make system-wide 
changes.
